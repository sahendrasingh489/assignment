//Database :- 

    A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically 
    stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for efficient storage,
     retrieval, and management of data. Databases are used in a wide range of applications,
      from managing customer information in a business to handling complex scientific data.


//Example: 

    Consider an online shopping platform. The database stores information about products,
     customers, orders, and inventory. When you search for a product, 
     the database quickly retrieves and displays the relevant information based on your 
     query.

//Why We Need a Database:

1.  Efficiency: Databases can handle large volumes of data efficiently and allow for
     quick retrieval and manipulation.

2.  Data Integrity: Databases enforce rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

3.  Data Security: Databases offer access control mechanisms to protect data from 
    unauthorized access.

4.  Concurrent Access: Multiple users can access and modify the data simultaneously 
    without conflicts.

5.  Backup and Recovery: Databases provide mechanisms to back up data and restore it in 
    case of failures.
