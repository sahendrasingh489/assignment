//File-Based Storage System :-
    
    A file-based storage system stores data in files and folders on a disk. Each file 
    typically represents a collection of data and is managed by the operating system.

//Major Challenges:

1.  Data Redundancy: The same data may be stored in multiple files, leading to duplication 
    and increased storage costs.

2.  Data Integrity: Maintaining data consistency across files is challenging, especially with 
    concurrent access.

3.  Scalability: As the volume of data grows, managing and searching through files becomes 
    inefficient.

4.  Lack of Security: File-based systems usually have limited access control mechanisms.

5.  Difficulty in Data Sharing: Sharing and integrating data between different files and 
    systems can be cumbersome.
