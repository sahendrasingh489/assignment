// DBMS:-
    
        A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that provides an interface
         to manage databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data 
         in a structured and efficient manner.

// Need for DBMS:

1.  Data Management: DBMS provides tools for handling large amounts of data efficiently.

2.  Data Security: It includes access controls to ensure that only authorized users can 
    access or modify the data.

3.  Data Integrity: DBMS enforces rules and constraints to maintain data accuracy.

4.  Data Redundancy Reduction: DBMS helps in minimizing data duplication through 
    normalization.
    
5.  Backup and Recovery: It provides mechanisms to back up data and recover it in case of 
    failures.
