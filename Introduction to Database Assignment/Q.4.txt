//Challenges of File-Based Storage System Tackled by DBMS:-

1.  Data Redundancy: DBMS uses normalization techniques to eliminate data redundancy and 
    ensure data is stored only once.

2.  Data Integrity: DBMS enforces constraints and rules (like primary keys, foreign keys) 
        to maintain data consistency and accuracy.

3.  Scalability: DBMS can handle large volumes of data and provide efficient querying 
    capabilities.

4.  Security: DBMS offers robust access control mechanisms to protect data from unauthorized 
    access.

5.  Concurrent Access: DBMS supports concurrent data access by multiple users while ensuring 
    data consistency through transaction management.
