//Types of Classification in DBMS

    1.  Hierarchical Model: Organizes data in a tree-like structure, with a parent-child 
                            relationship. Each child node has only one parent.

        //Example: A companyâ€™s organizational chart.

    2.  Network Model: Similar to the hierarchical model but allows more complex 
                        relationships with multiple parent nodes.

        //Example: A university database where a student can enroll in multiple courses 
                    and each course can have multiple students.
                    
    
    3.  Relational Model: Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. 
                            Tables can be linked using keys.
                            

        //Example: A database for a library with tables for books, authors, and borrowers.

    4.  Object-Oriented Model: Stores data as objects, similar to how data is handled in
                                object-oriented programming.

        //Example: A CAD system where shapes and components are stored as objects.
    
    5.Document Model: Stores data in document formats like JSON or XML. Often used in
                        NoSQL databases.

        //Example: A blog platform where each post is stored as a document.
