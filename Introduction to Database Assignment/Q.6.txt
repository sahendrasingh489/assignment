//Significance of Data Modeling :-

        Data Modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of the 
        data and its relationships in a database. It helps in designing the structure 
        and organization of the database to meet specific business needs.

//Types of Data Modeling:

    1.  Conceptual Data Modeling: Defines the high-level relationships and entities without 
        focusing on how they will be implemented.

        //Example: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
    
    2.  Logical Data Modeling: Focuses on the structure of the data elements and 
            their relationships, independent of physical implementation.

        //Example: Defining tables, columns, and keys in a relational model.
    
    3.  Physical Data Modeling: Details the actual implementation of the 
        database, including storage and indexing strategies.

        //Example: Defining indexes and partitions.
