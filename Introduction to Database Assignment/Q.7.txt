//Schema Architecture :-

1.Single Schema: All data and metadata are stored in a single schema, which is accessed 
    directly by the applications.

Advantages: Simple to manage and understand.
Disadvantages: Limited flexibility and scalability.

2.Two-Tier Architecture: Divides the database into two schemas, typically separating 
    the user interface from the database.

Advantages: Improved scalability and easier management of data and applications.
Disadvantages: Can be complex to manage and requires coordination between layers.

3.Three-Tier Architecture: Involves three layers: the presentation layer (user interface), 
    the application layer (business logic), and the data layer (database).

Advantages: Provides clear separation of concerns, enhancing scalability, maintainability, 
            and security.
Disadvantages: More complex to implement and manage, requiring careful design and 
                coordination.
