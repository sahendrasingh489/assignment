// Answer to describe (,) 'comma'.

In JavaScript, the comma operator (,) is used to evaluate multiple expressions in a single
 statement, returning the result of the last expression. Each expression is evaluated from 
 left to right, but only the result of the last expression is returned.

 let x = (2 + 3, 4 + 5);
    
    console.log(x);               // Output: 9
