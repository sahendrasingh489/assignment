A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed electronically.
 Databases are designed to handle large amounts of information efficiently and allow for
  various operations such as querying, updating, and managing data. They enable users to
   store, retrieve, and manipulate data in an organized manner.


Example of Need for a Database:

Imagine a library system that needs to manage information about books, members,
 and transactions. Without a database, you might use simple spreadsheets or physical 
 files. However, this approach would be inefficient for handling large volumes of data, 
 performing complex queries, or maintaining data integrity.
