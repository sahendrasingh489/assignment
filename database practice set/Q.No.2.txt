A file-based storage system stores data in files on a file system. Each file is 
treated as a discrete entity, and data is typically organized in a structured format, 
such as CSV, XML, or JSON.


Challenges of File-Based Storage System:

1.  Data Redundancy: The same data might be stored in multiple files, leading to 
    redundancy and inconsistency.
2.  Data Integrity: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across multiple files is
    difficult without built-in mechanisms.
3.  Scalability: As the volume of data grows, managing and accessing files efficiently 
    becomes challenging.
4.  Concurrent Access: Handling simultaneous access by multiple users or processes can 
    lead to conflicts and data corruption.
5.  Complex Queries: Performing complex queries or joining data across multiple files is
    cumbersome and inefficient.
