//Challenges of File-Based Storage System Tackled by DBMS :

1.  Data Redundancy and Inconsistency: DBMS minimizes redundancy and ensures consistency 
    through normalization and centralized data management.

2.  Data Integrity: DBMS enforces data integrity constraints, such as primary keys, 
    foreign keys, and unique constraints.
    
3.  Scalability: DBMS systems are designed to handle large volumes of data and scale 
    efficiently.

4.  Concurrent Access: DBMS provides transaction management and concurrency control    
    to handle simultaneous data access.

5.  Complex Query Handling: DBMS supports complex querying through SQL and other query 
    languages, enabling sophisticated data retrieval and manipulation.
