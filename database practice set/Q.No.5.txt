//Types of Classification in DBMS

1.  Hierarchical Database Model: Data is organized in a tree-like structure with 
    parent-child relationships. Examples include early database systems like IBM's 
    Information Management System (IMS).

2.  Network Database Model: Data is represented as a graph with multiple relationships 
    between records. Examples include Integrated Data Store (IDS).

3.  Relational Database Model: Data is organized into tables (relations) with rows and 
    columns. Relationships are established using foreign keys. Examples include MySQL, 
    PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

4.  Object-Oriented Database Model: Data is represented as objects, similar to 
    object-oriented programming concepts. Examples include ObjectDB and db4o.

5.  NoSQL Database Models: Includes various types such as document-based (MongoDB), 
    key-value stores (Redis), column-family stores (Cassandra), and graph databases (Neo4j). 
    These models are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and scale 
    horizontally.
