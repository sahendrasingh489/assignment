//Significance of Data Modelling :-

Data Modelling is the process of defining the structure, relationships, and constraints 
of data within a database. It helps in organizing data efficiently and ensures that 
the database design meets the requirements of the application.

//Types of Data Modelling:

1.  Conceptual Data Model: Focuses on the high-level organization of data, 
    including entities, relationships, and constraints, without considering 
    implementation details. Example: Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.

2.  Logical Data Model: Provides a more detailed view of the data structure, including 
    data types, relationships, and constraints. It is independent of the DBMS and focuses 
    on how data is organized. Example: Relational schema.

3.  Physical Data Model: Describes how data is stored and accessed in the database, 
    including details about indexing, storage structures, and performance optimization. 
    Example: Index structures and partitioning.
