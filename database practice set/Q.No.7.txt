//  Three Schema Architecture :-

1.  Internal Schema: Describes the physical storage of data on the hardware. 
    It details how data is stored and managed in terms of physical structures, 
    such as files and indexes.

2.  Conceptual Schema: Represents the logical view of the entire database, focusing on 
    the structure and relationships between data without considering the physical storage. 
    It provides a unified view of the database.

3.  External Schema: Defines how data is viewed and accessed by different users or 
    applications. It includes user views and access control.

//Advantages:

1.  Data Abstraction: Separates the physical storage from the logical structure, 
    allowing changes to be made to one layer without affecting others.

2.  Data Independence: Provides logical and physical data independence, meaning changes 
    in storage structures do not impact the application or data model.

3.  Security and Access Control: Allows different views and access controls for different 
    users, enhancing security and user-specific data access.
