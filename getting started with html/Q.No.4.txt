//Tags and Elements in HTML:-

    In HTML (HyperText Markup Language), tags are used to define the structure 
    and presentation of content on the web. An element consists of the opening 
    tag, content (if any), and the closing tag (or sometimes it is self-closing).

//Tag:  
    A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that tells the browser 
    how to display content.

//Element: 
    An element is a combination of the opening tag, content, and the closing 
    tag (if applicable). The element defines a specific structure or content 
    block on a webpage.

    // Example: 
            <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
