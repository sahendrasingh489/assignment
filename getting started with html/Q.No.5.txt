<!--    DOCTYPE  declaration  -->

    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML is used to specify the version of HTML 
    that the document is written in. It helps the web browser understand how to 
    render the content of the page correctly.

//Purpose

1.  Compatibility: Ensures that the browser renders the page according to the 
    rules of the specified HTML version.
    
2.  Standards Mode: Triggers standards mode in modern browsers, which ensures
     that the page is rendered using the HTML and CSS standards rather than in 
     "quirks mode" (which emulates older, non-standard behavior).
